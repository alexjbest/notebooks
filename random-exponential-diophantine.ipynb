    "such curves (with one variable squared and the other cubed) are known as elliptic curves, normally the equation looks like\n",
    "$$y^2 = x^3 + ax + b$$\n",

    "The upshot of this is that we have a finite list of possible $d$s (as they are only divisible by $2,3,7$ and squarefree, $d$ must be one of $1, 2, 3, 7, 6, 14, 21, 42$)\n",
    "Moreover given any elliptic curve, the set of integral points on that curve is finite (this is a theorem due to Siegel), and this set can be computed via Sage or other software. So we have a finite list of curves, and only finitely many points to check for each curve to see if they gave us a solution to the original problem (we have to check that the $(x,y)$ we found has $d|x$ and $d^2|y$ and all that the primes required divide $d m^2$)."
